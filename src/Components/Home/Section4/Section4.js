              As a backend developer, I employ the Rails MVC architecture for
              creating and managing database models. I use JavaScript and Ruby
              on Rails in facilitating database integrations, with an emphasis
              on PostgreSQL for database design, querying, and optimization. I
              prioritize data integrity and reliability with Test-driven
              development practices using Jest and RSpec. In API development I
              utilize Postman for verification of data connectivity, while
              applying RESTful routes methodologies.
